# Creating Complete 95-Table Migration

## ✅ Tables Received from Database

You have **95 tables** in your production database. I've received the complete list.

## 🎯 What I'm Going to Do

I'm creating a comprehensive migration file that includes ALL 95 tables by:

1. Reading each table's structure from your existing migrations
2. Combining all schemas into one consolidated file
3. Adding all triggers, functions, RLS policies, and storage buckets
4. Ensuring proper dependency order

## ⏱️ Estimated Time

Given the size (95 tables + all their relationships), this will create a file of approximately:
- **4,000-5,000 lines** of SQL
- **150-200 KB** in size
- **ALL database objects** from your production schema

## 📝 Approach

Since this is too large for a single operation, I'll create the migration in **modular chunks** that you can:
- Either combine into one file
- Or run sequentially

## 🚀 Starting Now...

Creating comprehensive migration based on all 95 tables from your production database.
