# Production Team Database Setup

## Overview
The Production Team feature has been implemented with a new database table `production_team` to store Pattern Masters, Cutting Managers, and Tailors.

## Database Migration

### Option 1: Manual SQL Execution (Recommended)
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250821000000_create_production_team.sql`
4. Execute the SQL

### Option 2: Using Supabase CLI
```bash
# Install Supabase CLI if not already installed
npm install -g supabase

# Login to Supabase
supabase login

# Link your project (if not already linked)
supabase link --project-ref tqqhqxfvxgrxxqtcjacl

# Push the migration
supabase db push
```
